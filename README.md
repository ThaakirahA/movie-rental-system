## 📌 Project Overview

The **Movie Rental System** is a web-based application that allows users to browse, search, and rent movies online.

The system provides a digital alternative to traditional movie rental stores by allowing users to manage their rentals through a simple and intuitive web interface.

The application uses **Angular** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express** for the backend API. Data is stored in **MongoDB** hosted on **MongoDB Atlas**.

### Architecture Explanation

**Frontend (Angular)**
Provides the user interface where customers browse movies and administrators manage the catalog.

**Backend (Node.js + Express)**
Processes business logic, authentication, and handles API requests between the frontend and the database.

**Database (MongoDB Atlas)**
Stores application data including users, movies, and rental records.

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. User opens the web application.
2. User registers or logs into the system.
3. User browses the movie catalog.
4. User searches or selects a movie.
5. The system processes the rental request.
6. Rental information is stored in the database.
7. The system confirms the rental to the user.
